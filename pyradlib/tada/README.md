# Treatment and Dose Assessor
This subpackage provides functionality for the assessment of treatment dosimetric quality and deliverability. The Treatment and Dose Assessor (TADA) code was previously implemented in C# by Scott Crowe during post-doctoral research fellowship at the Queensland University of Technology.

### Conformity indices
Many of the complexity metrics implemented in this code were described in the Feuvret review:

The conformation number (CN), also known as Paddick's conformity index (PCI), is described in:
