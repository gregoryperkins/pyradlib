# Monte Carlo DICOM ToolKit
This subpackage provides functionality for the Monte Carlo simulation of radiotherapy treatments. The Monte Carlo DICOM ToolKit (MCDTK) code was previously implemented in Java and C# by Scott Crowe during PhD candidature and post-doctoral fellowship  at the Queensland University of Technology.
